Experimental HTML5 &lt;audio&gt; visualization, using map

<img src="http://i.imgur.com/TwxQe.png"/>

Based on Grant Skinner's work ( see <a href="http://gskinner.com/blog/archives/2011/03/music-visualizer-in-html5-js-with-source-code.html">Music Visualizer in HTML5 /JS</a> )

With musicselector.html, it's possible to create a visualization at any location.
Default to Santa Cruz.

MusicShow and MusicShow2 invert the area which includes the audio visualization ( for example: water included versus water excluded ).
